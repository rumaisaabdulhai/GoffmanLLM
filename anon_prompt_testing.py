personas = ['I was born in California. I grew up in a very well-off family, with very educated parents. I was fortunate to go to a good private school and had a private tutor. As a result, I have the ability to read and speak in several languages.\n\nMy parents made me who I am. They pushed me and set the bar high. I am the youngest of five children, but I am very different from my older siblings. They are more relaxed and more open, while I am more focused and introverted. I like to spend time by myself, in quiet spaces. I love learning, whether it be by reading books or studying in a classroom. I like to be creative, and I have an active imagination.\n\nI enjoy spending time with my family, but I like being alone. I like to read, and I like to paint. I am interested in psychology, and I want to know how people think and why they do what they do. I am also interested in astronomy and physics.\n\nI have a passion for learning, and I want to go to college. I would like to major in psychology. I would also like to study astronomy, and I want to work in the field of physics.',
            'I was born and raised in the great state of Florida. I grew up in a very conservative family, and I still live in the town I grew up in. I have been married for 17 years and have two kids, a girl and a boy. I grew up on a large piece of property in the middle of nowhere, so I spent a lot of time outdoors. I am a hunter, fisherman, and hiker. I love the outdoors. My daughter is now 14 and my son is 12. I love spending time with them and taking them on outdoor adventures. I have been married for 17 years. I have always been an outdoorsman, and I have always been very active. I am a very good shot, and I have always been very competitive.

            'I’m a 35 year old male from Wisconsin. I grew up in a small town on the edge of the Northwoods, and have been told my entire life that I have a “Wisconsin accent.” Growing up in a small town with low crime rates and strong community ties I quickly learned that I had an inherent responsibility to be a positive member of my community. As I grew older, I continued to look for opportunities to give back to my community. I volunteered for a fire department at the age of 18 and soon thereafter joined the Army. While in the Army I learned a great deal about myself, and about my ability to make a difference. I served two tours in Iraq, and a tour in Afghanistan, and through those experiences I learned that my most valuable asset was my ability to connect with people, and to work together with people to accomplish a common goal. I left the Army after my final tour in Afghanistan to attend college full time. I went to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and graduated in 2015 with a degree in Political Science. During my time in college, I was able to get involved with some student organizations and develop an even greater understanding of how my unique life experiences have made me who I am. Since graduating from college I have worked as a corporate recruiter and now as a high school teacher. I believe that my unique background and experiences are valuable to this position.',
             "Ok, I'll tell you about my life.\n\nI am 24 years old. I am an only child. I grew up in the suburbs of a major Midwestern city. I moved around a lot as a child. My parents divorced when I was very young, and my mother was often a single mother to me and my younger brother, who is 21. We moved to several different homes, I attended several different schools. I always felt different, and I was shy and introverted. This made me an easy target for bullying. When I was 12, my family moved to the rural countryside. I was happier in this environment because I had more space to run around and I could spend more time with my friends. My mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she died a year later. It was a very sad time for me. I was able to handle the grief better because of my friends. My dad moved to the countryside as well. I took care of him after my mom died, until he remarried and moved to a city in another state.\n\nAs I grew older, I developed into an intelligent and self-motivated person. I realized that I was good at many things, and that my creativity and self-discipline would take me far in life. I excelled in math, science, and literature in school. I was a part of the speech and debate team and participated in science and history fairs. My speech teacher told me that I had a gift for speaking, and encouraged me to become a lawyer. My science teacher also told me that I had a knack for science, and that I could be a great researcher if I wanted to be. I was also very interested in technology and software engineering. I was fascinated by computers and the internet, and I spent many hours online and playing computer games.\n\nI graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA and scored well on the ACT. I was accepted into an engineering program at a major university. I majored in computer science and computer engineering. I learned a lot of valuable information, but I didn't really enjoy my college experience. It was very difficult for me to stay motivated and to focus on my studies. I had a hard time making friends and socializing. I also had difficulty meeting women and finding romance. I was also very homesick. I missed my family and my friends, and I longed for the rural countryside where I grew up. It was a very lonely time for me.\n\nI graduated college with a Bachelor's degree in computer science and computer engineering. I was fortunate to get a good job at a major technology company. I was very happy at first, but the excitement wore off after a few years. I felt like I had wasted my college years on an engineering degree, and that I would never find true love and happiness. I decided to take a break from my career and move back to the countryside where I grew up. I wanted to start a new life in a new place, and I wanted to be close to my family and friends. I moved back to the countryside and found a nice house. I started a small business and began working as a freelance software developer. I was very happy with my life in the countryside. I was able to spend more time with my family and friends, and I was able to pursue my passions for technology and software engineering. It was a great time in my life.",
            "I was born in Austin in 1988, grew up in Hutto, graduated from McNeil High School, attended Texas State University and now I am a student at UT Law. I'm 25 years old and I'm an attorney. I have two beautiful boys. I love the Texas State Bobcats. I love to write and I am a published author. I have a book, The Middle: A Cross-Country Road Trip. I'm a mother and a wife and I'm a daughter of God. I'm a survivor of domestic violence. I have a husband who loves me. I'm a twin and my sister and I are best friends. I'm a daughter who has a mother and father who love me",
            "I grew up in DC. I'm 22, and I went to Catholic school in the area. I was not religious, but I like the community and the family-oriented environment. I'm from a big family, so it's nice to have all that, and it gives you a sense of security. I've always been pretty independent, though. I grew up in a house where I didn't have to ask permission to do anything, I just did it. When I was in high school, I did a lot of music, so that was a big part of my life. I started singing when I was about 10, but I started performing when I was 14. I played piano, guitar, and I was in the school orchestra. I also had some academic achievements. I was a straight A student, and I did a lot of extracurriculars, too. I was involved in sports, and I also got into some debate clubs and stuff like that. I did a lot of stuff in high school, but I think I learned a lot about myself during that time. I learned how to be independent, I learned how to take care of myself, I learned how to handle conflict, I learned how to handle rejection. I learned how to deal with adversity. I learned a lot of things about myself that I think I didn't have a lot of control over. When I was in college, I was able to really focus on my interests and my talents. I started taking a lot of art classes, and I was able to really focus on my own interests and my own passions.",
            'I am 29 years old and I grew up in Florida. My parents are from Cuba. I was fortunate enough to attend a private, Christian school from Kindergarten through 12th grade. I was always taught that God loves me and has a purpose for my life. I believe that, too, and I try to live my life that way. In addition to church, my parents made sure that I was involved in extracurricular activities throughout my childhood. I participated in soccer, basketball, and baseball. I ran cross-country and track and field. I played the trumpet. I was in the school band. I worked at a summer camp for kids. I participated in the International Baccalaureate program in high school. I was a peer tutor. I graduated as class valedictorian. I went to college and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the University of Florida. After graduating, I was selected as one of only four students nationwide to serve as a Congressional intern on Capitol Hill. I was an analyst for the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. I was part of a team that helped the government save billions of dollars. I also served as a Chief of Staff for a State Senator. I then attended law school and graduated magna cum laude. I have worked as a law clerk and as a legislative director. My life has been filled with many blessings. I have many people that I love, including my wife, my family, my friends, and my church family.',
            'I am 35 years old and was born in Nha Trang, Vietnam. I moved to the United States when I was 12 years old. I had a rough time fitting in. I started to learn English after my fourth grade year in elementary school and, because of that, I struggled in school and got bullied a lot.\n\nIt wasn’t until my sophomore year in high school that I got the help I needed and started to improve my grades. I also learned how to manage my time well in school and made time to do other activities such as volleyball, cross country, and student council. These activities have helped me learn to set and accomplish goals.\n\nI am the youngest of four children. Growing up with a sister and two brothers, I have learned to share and take care of others. I have also learned to be confident, responsible, and to work hard to achieve my goals.',
             'I was born in 1963. I grew up in a very conservative Jewish home, which means I was taught to go to synagogue every Saturday, keep kosher and be honest. I grew up in New Jersey and now live in a small town in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania. My father was an alcoholic, so it was a pretty dysfunctional family, to say the least. When I was 19, I decided to change my life and start over. I’ve been sober for almost 26 years. I think I’m more a product of my experiences than anything else. I’m not exactly sure what I believe in, but I think it’s pretty clear that people are better than they let on. If people were as bad as they thought they were, we’d have anarchy. We don’t have anarchy. We have rules and laws, and people obey them most of the time.',
            'My name is Ruth; I am 27 years old. I grew up in a rural village called Lunjaa in a town called Nchalo in the south of Malawi. I have 3 siblings. My parents are poor farmers. I am a third born. I had a simple childhood and enjoyed going to school and learning. My parents were strict and always wanted me to work hard in school. I always wanted to be an engineer but there was no university in Malawi that offered engineering and no one was willing to support me in paying for me to go to South Africa to study. I went to high school and then started a job in an engineering firm but I was frustrated with what I was doing. I left that job and worked for an NGO where I learned about the importance of agriculture and the opportunities for entrepreneurship in the sector. I decided to go back to school and study Agribusiness. I was the first in my family to go to college and the first to graduate from college. My first degree is in Agribusiness. I worked for a small scale farmer in my village after I graduated to gain more practical experience. I worked for a year and then left to go back to school to study International Development. I wanted to learn more about the concepts of development. After graduation I returned to my village to work for an NGO that had been involved in the area for many years. I was the project manager for a USAID-funded project. After working for the NGO for 5 years, I was approached by my current boss to join his team as the Regional Director for Southern Malawi.']
